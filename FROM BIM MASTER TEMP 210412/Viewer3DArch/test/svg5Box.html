                    How many roads must a man walk down
                    Before you call him a man?
                    How many seas must a white dove sail
                    Before she sleeps in the sand?
                    How many times must the cannon balls fly
                    Before they're forever banned?
                    The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
                    The answer is blowin' in the wind
                    How many years can a mountain exist
                    Before it's washed to the sea?
                    How many years must some people exist
                    Before they're allowed to be free?
                    And how many times can a man turn his head
                    And pretend that he just doesn't see - the answer
                    The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
                    The answer is blowin' in the wind
                    How many times can a man look up
                    Before he sees the sky?
                    How many ears must oneâ€¦
